## Node.js + MongoDB User API

This project is a simple Express API connected to a MongoDB database. It provides a GET endpoint to fetch user data by ID, returning only users older than 21 and handling invalid IDs gracefully. The goal was to keep the setup clean and follow good practices with routing and error handling.
